    is sent (useful for partner/payment gateways). Both transport errors
    (connect refused, timeouts) and 5xx responses count as failures.

    Trace-context propagation is handled by OTel's httpx instrumentation (see

    app's lifetime (e.g. via a ``LifespanResource``) instead of creating one
    per request.

    ``transport`` replaces the default retrying transport — useful for tests
    (``httpx.MockTransport``) or a custom transport. The circuit breaker, when
