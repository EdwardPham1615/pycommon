class MetricsMiddleware:
    """Record ``http.server.request.duration`` and ``http.server.active_requests``.

    Kept separate from :class:`~pycommon.http.middleware.request_context.RequestContextMiddleware`
    even though both time the request: metrics and access logs have different
    blast radii — a bad attribute here costs money in the metrics backend, a bad
    field there only costs log volume — and services that export metrics some
    other way can drop this layer without losing their access log.

    **Cardinality is the whole design.** Every attribute is drawn from a bounded
    set: the normalized method, the response status, and ``http.route`` — the
    *template* (``/users/{id}``), never the raw path. Unmatched requests (404,
    or anything short-circuited before routing) carry no route attribute at all
    rather than their path, because that path is attacker-controlled.

    Sits *outside* ``RequestContextMiddleware`` so that unhandled exceptions,
    which that layer turns into a 500 Problem Details response, are counted as
    ``http.response.status_code=500`` like any other error response.
