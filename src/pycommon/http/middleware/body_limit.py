    Internal to the middleware: it is raised inside the handler's call to read
    the body and caught one frame away, in ``__call__``. It exists as a real
    exception rather than a sentinel message because the handler must *stop*,
    and returning a short body would instead hand it a truncated payload to
    parse as if it were complete.
    """


class BodySizeLimitMiddleware:
    """Cap the request body a service will accept.

    A JSON endpoint with no limit will happily buffer whatever it is sent.
    ``json.loads`` on a gigabyte allocates several more, so one request from one
    client can take the process down — no volume needed, which is what separates
    this from rate limiting.

    Two checks, because either alone is insufficient:

    * ``Content-Length``, when present, is rejected before a single byte of body
      is read. That is the cheap path and covers ordinary clients.
    * The streamed bytes are counted regardless, because ``Content-Length`` is
      optional under chunked transfer encoding and is in any case a claim by the
      caller. A limit that trusts it stops honest clients and nobody else.

    Install innermost, which :func:`~pycommon.http.middleware.apply_standard_middleware`
    does. Exceeding the limit mid-stream raises out of the handler's own
    ``await request.body()``, and that exception must reach this middleware
    before any layer that renders unhandled exceptions as 500s — otherwise a
    body that is too large is reported as a server error, and the client is told
    the fault was ours.
