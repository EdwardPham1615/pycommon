    """Cap how long a handler may take before the request is abandoned.

    Without one, a handler blocked on an upstream that never answers holds its
    connection, its database session and its worker slot indefinitely. Enough of
    them and the service stops serving anything, while every health check still
    passes — the process is fine, it is just entirely occupied.

    **The timeout covers time-to-first-byte, not the whole response.** Once the
    handler has produced ``http.response.start`` the deadline is lifted and the
    body streams for as long as it needs. A wall-clock limit on the complete response
    would kill exactly the endpoints that legitimately run long — server-sent
    events, large downloads, streamed exports — and those are not the failure
    this exists to catch.

    On expiry the handler task is **cancelled**, not merely abandoned. Answering
    504 while the work continues would leave the database session checked out and
    the upstream call in flight, which is the resource leak this is meant to
    prevent, minus the visibility.

    If the response has already started when the timeout fires there is no way to
    send a 504 — the status line is gone. The connection is closed instead, and
    the event is logged, because a truncated response is worth knowing about.

        in the logs, while a proxy timeout returns the proxy's own error page and
