"""Base settings and reusable nested settings groups.

Nested groups are plain ``BaseModel`` (not ``BaseSettings``) on purpose: a
``BaseSettings`` subclass instantiated standalone reads *bare* environment
variables (e.g. field ``user`` would pick up the shell's ``$USER``). As plain
models they are only populated through the parent settings class via the
``__`` nested delimiter (e.g. ``POSTGRES__HOST``).

Usage in a service::

    class Settings(BaseAppSettings):
        app_name: str = "my-service"
        postgres: DatabaseSettings = DatabaseSettings()
        keycloak: KeycloakSettings = KeycloakSettings()
