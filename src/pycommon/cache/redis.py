    Keep one client per app alive for the process lifetime (e.g. via a
    ``LifespanResource`` that calls ``client.aclose()`` on shutdown). Each call
    builds its own connection pool, so calling it per request would defeat
    pooling entirely.

    Timeouts are set explicitly: redis-py blocks forever by default, so a hung
    connection would pin an event-loop task indefinitely rather than failing
    fast. ``health_check_interval`` pings idle connections before reuse, which
    is what keeps a pool behind a load balancer from handing out sockets the
    balancer has already dropped.
