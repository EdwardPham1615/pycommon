    instead of scattering across it the way v4 does — the difference shows up as
    write amplification and index bloat on a large table, not as anything you
    would notice in development.

    The default is generated in Python rather than by the database, so the value
    is known once the session flushes and needs no ``RETURNING`` round trip to
    read back. Note it is a *column* default: the attribute is ``None`` until
    flush, so code that needs the id earlier must call ``session.flush()``
