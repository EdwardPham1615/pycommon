"""ObjectStorageClient against a real S3 server (MinIO).

The unit tests drive a fake S3 client, which proves the wrapper calls the right
methods with the right arguments. It cannot prove the arguments are the ones a
server accepts — addressing style, signature version, and presigned URL
construction are all decided by botocore and only observable against something
that answers like S3.
