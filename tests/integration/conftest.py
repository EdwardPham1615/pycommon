"""Integration tests against real backing services.

Each group is skipped unless its URL is in the environment, so the default
`pytest` run stays offline and fast. CI provides both as service containers::

    REDIS_TEST_URL=redis://localhost:6379/15 \\
    POSTGRES_TEST_DSN=postgresql+asyncpg://user:pw@localhost:5432/db \\
        uv run pytest tests/integration

URLs come from the environment rather than constants because a developer's
services may require credentials, and those do not belong in the tree.

These exist because the rest of the suite runs on substitutes that do not model
what the code depends on. ``fakeredis`` does not faithfully execute Lua, has no
server-side ``TIME``, and does not really expire keys. SQLite has no statement
timeout, no advisory locks, no ``ON CONFLICT ON CONSTRAINT``, and coerces types
that asyncpg rejects outright. A green run against either proves the Python is
coherent, not that it works against the database the service actually runs.
