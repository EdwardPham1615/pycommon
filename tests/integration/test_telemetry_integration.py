"""setup_telemetry against a real OTLP collector.

The existing telemetry tests assert control flow with the SDK mocked out, which
proves the branches are right and nothing about whether spans leave the process.
Exporter configuration is exactly the kind of thing that looks correct and
silently drops everything: a wrong endpoint, a TLS mismatch, a provider that was
never flushed. The only way to know is to ask the collector what it received.

Each scenario runs in a **subprocess**. ``setup_telemetry`` installs a
process-global TracerProvider once and later calls reuse it, so running it inside
the test session would either contaminate every other test or silently reuse a
provider some earlier test had installed — and then pass without exporting
anything.
