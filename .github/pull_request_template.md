## What

<!-- One or two sentences on what this changes. -->

## Why

<!--
The part reviewers need most. What was the behaviour before, what does it break,
and why this fix rather than another? A reviewer who understands the failure can
tell you the fix is wrong; one who only sees the diff can only say it looks fine.
-->

## How it was verified

<!--
Which tests fail without this change? For a bug fix, a test that reproduces the
original failure -- not just one that exercises the new code path.
-->

## Breaking changes

<!--
None, or: what breaks, and the migration. Show before and after. A consumer
should be able to follow it without reading the diff.

This library is shared by several services, so a breaking change is an upgrade
someone else has to absorb.
-->

None.
